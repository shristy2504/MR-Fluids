# MR-Fluids
Magneto-Rheological (MR) brakes use smart fluids that change viscosity in the presence of a magnetic field, enabling smooth, adjustable braking without mechanical friction. This project explores the core design of such a system and analyzes its potential in modern vehicles. 

This is the ppt that i presented during my Seminar , It gives a brief background knowledge about Magnetorheological Fluids  , discuss the application and analyize the experimental results with different parameters .
